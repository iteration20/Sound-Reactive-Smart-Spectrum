# Sound-Reactive-Smart-Spectrum
A sensor integration based Do It Yourself (DIY) Project. It was a very inspiring project.

I was getting bored on a random day during COVID-19 lockdown. I glanced into my Sensor box and discovered an analog sound sensor LM386. So I constructed the project with the components I had at the time. The experiment resulted in my Static RGB LED Strip becoming a reactive Strip based on melody and harmony, which I find quite exhilarating while listening to music at night in a dark environment.
